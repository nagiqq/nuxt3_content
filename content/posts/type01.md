The British Museum is unique in bringing together under one roof the cultures of the world, spanning continents and
oceans. No other museum is responsible for collections of the same depth and breadth, beauty and significance.Its eight
million objects allow us to explore the extraordinary diversity of human cultures, from small communities to vast
empires, to discover the many forms and expressions human beings have given to every aspect of life, and to realise how
closely they are interconnected.
