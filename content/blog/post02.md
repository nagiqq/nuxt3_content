The masterpieces on display in Eugène Delacroix’s last apartment and studio include Mary Magdalene in the Desert (a painting greatly admired by Baudelaire), The Education of the Virgin, Romeo and Juliet and the fresco Bacchus with a Tiger. There are also lesser known works such as the Study of Bindings, Oriental Jacket and Figures after Goya, characteristic of the artist’s creativity, and a model for the decor of the library at the Assemblée Nationale. Sketches, finished paintings, prints and drawings in various techniques introduce visitors to the broad range of the artist’s talent and cast light on his creative process. The museum also displays portraits of Delacroix and copies of his major works (The Death of Sardanapalus, Women of Algiers, etc.) by his friends or admirers such as Henri Fantin-Latour.
